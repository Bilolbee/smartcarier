RESUME GENERATION PROMPT TEMPLATES
=============================================================================

This file contains all prompt templates for AI resume generation.
Prompts are the instructions we send to GPT-4 to generate content.

WHY USE PROMPT TEMPLATES?
1. Consistency - Same format every time
2. Maintainability - Update prompts in one place
3. Testability - Easy to test different prompts
4. Reusability - Use across different features

PROMPT ENGINEERING TIPS:
- Be specific and detailed in instructions
- Provide examples when possible
- Define the exact output format expected
- Use system messages for role/persona
- Set constraints to prevent unwanted output

USAGE:
    from app.prompts.resume_prompts import ResumePromptTemplate
    
    template = ResumePromptTemplate()
    prompt = template.get_generation_prompt(
        job_title="Software Engineer",
